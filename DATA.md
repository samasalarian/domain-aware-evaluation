# Data Documentation

This document describes the datasets used in this repository, their sources, and organization.

## Overview

All datasets have been preprocessed and are organized in the `data/` directory. The data supports three main analyses: variant effect prediction (VEP), evolutionary conservation analysis, and synthetic genome validity assessment.

## Data Sources

### TraitGym
Complex trait variant datasets for evolutionary conservation analysis.
- **Source:** [TraitGym Repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/songlab/TraitGym)
- **Reference:** TraitGym benchmark dataset for trait-associated variants

### ClinVar
Clinical variant database with pathogenicity annotations.
- **Source:** [ClinVar Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
- **Reference:** NCBI ClinVar database of genomic variation

### IDH Glioma
Somatic variants from TCGA IDH-mutant glioma patients.
- **Source:** [IDH glioma Database](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov)
- **Reference:** IDH-mutant glioma variant dataset

### M. genitalium Genome
Reference genome for synthetic genome generation analysis.
- **Source:** [NCBI RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Mycoplasma+genitalium)
- **Reference:** *Mycoplasma genitalium* G37 reference genome (GenBank: L43967.2)

## Data Organization

### `data/VEP/`
Variant Effect Prediction datasets.

**Contents:**
- ClinVar variants with computed scores, log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), and GO category annotations
- IDH glioma variants with computed scores, log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), and GO category annotations

**File format:** Preprocessed CSV files ready for analysis

**Columns include:**
- Variant information (chromosome, position, reference, alternate)
- Log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)
- Gene Ontology (GO) categories
- Pathogenicity labels

---

### `data/Conservation/`
Evolutionary conservation analysis datasets.

**Contents:**
- TraitGym complex trait variants
- PhastCons conservation scores
- Evo2 log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)

**File format:** Preprocessed files with alignment between variant effects and evolutionary constraints

**Columns include:**
- Variant information
- Trait associations
- PhastCons scores
- Evo2-derived LLRs

---

### `data/Validity/`
Synthetic genome validity assessment data.

**Directory structure:**
```
data/Validity/
├── genomes/       # Evo2-generated synthetic genomes and reference genomes
├── hmmer/         # HMMER domain search results
└── proteins/      # Predicted protein sequences and annotations
```

**Contents:**
- `genomes/`: Synthetic *M. genitalium* genomes generated by Evo2 with varying prompt lengths, plus natural reference genome
- `hmmer/`: Protein domain identification results using HMMER against Pfam database
- `proteins/`: Protein sequences predicted from synthetic genomes using Prodigal

## Data Access

All preprocessed data files are included in this repository under the `data/` directory. Original raw data can be obtained from the sources listed above.

## Preprocessing

All datasets have undergone preprocessing including:
- Quality filtering
- Annotation with model scores and LLRs
- Addition of evolutionary conservation metrics (PhastCons)
- Functional annotation (GO categories)
- Format standardization for analysis scripts

## Data Usage

Each analysis script expects data in the corresponding directory:
- `code/VEP.py` → `data/VEP/`
- `code/Conservation_A.py` → `data/Conservation/`
- `code/Validity.py` → `data/Validity/`

Ensure the data directory structure is maintained as described above for proper script execution.
